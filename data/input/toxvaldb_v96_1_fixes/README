The "missing_HESS_toxicological_effect_category_v96_1.xlsx" file is provided here to include DCAP records from the toxvaldb_v96_1 data pull that were missing toxicological_effect_category entries/assignments in the database table "toxicological_effect_terms". At the time the DCAP results for v96_1 were pulled, these new category assignments were applied to the output but were not stored in the v96_1 database. The toxvaldb_v96_1 database was already publicly released before this discrepancy was caught. To ensure the workflow is reproducible to the DCAP results publicly posted, this file was included.
